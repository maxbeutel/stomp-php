- improve transaction handling, return transaction id on begin and/or dont require to specify transaction id in send call
- improve unsubscribe logic as client code could remove system event listener
- find a good way to test produce/consume logic
- try to reconnect on EOF?
- catch connection exception on socketConnection->write() and rethrow with FrameException?
- when reconnected, the libevent socket must be exchanged/event loop must be restarted with new socket!
- update README and provide some documentation and install guide via composer
- investigate exceptions thrown while running examples
