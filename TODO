- improve transaction handling, return transaction id on begin and/or dont require to specify transaction id in send call
- handle exceptions/break event loop logic better... somehow...
	- try to reconnect on socket errors (EOF/could not write/etc)?
	- general rule: only try all uris on connect, otherwise throw exception and break loop?
- add ssl support (tests first!)
- move libevent handling to SocketConnection so it doesnt feel dirty anymore when throwing ConnectionException in errorCallback
- update README and provide some documentation and install guide via composer
- investigate exceptions thrown while running examples
- test error handling (make node server throw errors etc.)
- add unit tests for ALL examples
